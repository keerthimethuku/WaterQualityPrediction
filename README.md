# WaterQualityPrediction
Developed a machine learning-based system to predict multiple water quality parameters using chemical features of water samples. The model assists in identifying water potability and supports environmental safety initiatives.

Tech Stack:

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

Model Used: MultiOutput Regressor with Random Forest

Deployment: Streamlit (UI), GitHub (Codebase)

Workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing data, normalized features, and handled outliers.

Model Building: Trained a MultiOutput Random Forest Regressor to predict multiple target values simultaneously.

Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy using RÂ² score and RMSE metrics.

Deployment: Built an interactive UI using Streamlit to input water sample features and view predictions in real-time.
